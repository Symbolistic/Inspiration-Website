				<h1>Inspiration</h1>
				<p><em>“The process of being mentally stimulated to do or feel something, especially to do something creative”.</em></p>

				<p>This is the standard definition of inspiration. We become mentally stimulated (inspired) to do something. For those who want to feel inspired, the key is to learn how to create an inspired state when we need to. Inspiration comes during those moments when we see true human excellence. It’s an emotional experience that comes when we encounter extraordinary ability or competence in some activity, which motivates us to be better ourselves.</p>

				<p>Staying Inspired everyday is vital if you are pursuing something. It can be a career, sports, school, or even anything simple you might be pursuing. The problem is, staying inspired every single day isn't easy.</p>

				<h1>Motivation</h1>
				<p><em>"A reason or reasons for acting or behaving in a particular way."</em></p>

				<p>This is the standard definition of motivation. Let me start by saying Inspiration and Motivation are not the same thing. Motivation is something which builds your mindset, it gathers your senses and pulls you up from laziness and inactivity to do something, to achieve something, to build something. It is a force which wakes up your sleeping mind to get going. It doesn't let you sleep until you have achieved your dream. It is a first step which helps you in achieving great success. When you are motivated you are restless, energized.</p>

				<p>Inspiration is like an idea. An idea which tells your mind to be creative. It is a like a path which you want to follow but in your own way. You dream about that idea. Here it is all going inside your mind. An inspired mind doesn't do anything but is still. But that mind is creative. </p>

				<p>In short, inspiration is a seed and motivation is water. You can sow many seeds but you need water to let them grow.<p>

				<h1>Discipline</h1>
				<p><em>Discipline is the suppression of base desires, and is usually understood to be synonymous with restraint and self-control.</em></p>
				<p><em>Self-Discipline is the ability to control one's feelings and overcome one's weaknesses; the ability to pursue what one thinks is right despite temptations to abandon it.</em></p>
				<p>Jim Rohn once said, “Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going”.</p>

				<p>Why did I list two definitions? Because I want you to know the standard definition of both diciplines. We're focusing on YOU, so I want you to know what self-discipline means, as it relates to you. Self-disicipline is what you need. I believe inspiration comes first, ideas form in your mind, then motivation comes next, you see something that relates to what you are thinking about, that may motivate you, that is great but its missing one important thing. Discipline.</p>

				<p>Let me use an example from Sam Thomas Davies.</p>
				<p>"You have a goal. You want to lose 14 pounds, run a marathon or write a non-fiction book, but in order to achieve your goal, you need motivation, without it, you cannot start.

But motivation is not reliable; it ebbs and flows depending on your emotional state and if you’re “not in the mood”, you can let yourself off the hook.</p>

				<p>This is why discipline is important, even if you're sick, not feeling like doing what you need to do, not in the mood, you need to be disciplined enough to get past all those excuses and do what you need to do.</p>
