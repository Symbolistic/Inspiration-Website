					<li><b>Write down 5 things you want to accomplish by next year.</b> I want you to write this down or if you can type it in your computer, make it look nice, print it out, and hang it on the wall somewhere so you see it the moment you wake up everyday. Make sure you look and it everything and work towards achieving those 5 things by January of next year.</li>

					<li><b>Always surround yourself with anything that inspires you, music, pictures, people, it can be anything.</b> This will help keep your motivation fueled.</li>

					<li><b>Just start doing it!</b> For many people the hardest part is starting or getting to a place, but once you're there or you started, it becomes automatic and much easier to follow through.</li>

					<li><b>Make good habits</b>This is kind of like a part 2 to the above tip. It is said it take more than 2 months to form a habit. I believe it takes around a month only. Either way just start doing something, for example going to the gym for 2 months straight, don't skip any workout days for 2 months, you'll see how easy it is after that. This is because you turned it into a habit!</li>

					<li><b>Try to stay surrounded by positive people who share your goals and interests.</b> These people make it easier for you to continue your goals, try not to stay with people who have bad habits or they can bring you down with them</li>
