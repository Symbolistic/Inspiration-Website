					<li><b>The 3-Minute Rule.</b> I want to start off with this, because I feel its a good strategy. The 3 minute rule is simply, anything you don't feel like doing, just do it for 3 minutes, focus completely on it and nothing else and tell yourself you'll do this for the next 3 minutes and give it your all. Most likely what will happen is after those 3 minutes you'll continue doing it. The reason to this is because getting started is very difficult for some reason, but once you get started you build momentum and that keeps you going.</li>

					<li><b>Create a schedule.</b> This can be a daily or weekly schedule, just list out everything you will do and check them off as you complete them</li>

					<li><b>Follow through! Don't wait for it to "feel right".</b> Don't wait for that perfect moment, just go and do what you need to get done! You might not feel like waking up at 5AM and going to the gym but you need to fight your instints and drag yourself to the gym! Trust me, it will become much easier once your there!</li> 

					<li><b>Reward yourself</b> This is almost like the "take a day off and rest" suggestion I made on the inspiration page. After you completed your hard work go reward yourself with something. Dieting? Designate Saturday as ice cream sundae day. Trying to lose weight? Treat yourself with a fancy massage after a month of gym trips. Working on controlling your spending? Allow yourself a $25 splurge at the mall on Sunday. (Leave the credit cards at home, and bring cash only). Self discipline can be hard. Reward your effort.</li>

					<li><b>Missed a day? Messed up while working towards a goal? Its okay!</b> We're human, mistakes happen, the main thing is you just move forward and continue working towards your goals, you messed up so maybe try to make up for messing up by working a little harder, but just remember, just because you messed up once doesn't mean it is over, its over when you give up, so don't give up and keep going!</li>
