				<h1>How to stay inspired everyday!</h1>
				<p>Lets get right into it, I'll list the most important things you should be doing to stay inspired everyday</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>Surround yourself with things that inspire you.</b> Put things up on your walls that inspire you, so the moment you wake up you see something to get you inspired. Keep things with you that inspire you, pictures, music, a person in your life, anything. This is important, from the moment you wake up you should have that inspiration refueled, so when you wake up, the first thing on your mind or the first thing you see, should be something or someone that inspires you.</li>

					<li><b>Write down and/or find out 3 things that anger you.</b> Most likely your dream or goal will be to overcome those things. Example, you lost your girlfriend and that angered you. Well a goal will be for you to become a better person or to find someone better so that never happens to you again. So write down 3 things that anger you, really think about those things and why they anger you. Find out how you can overcome them. Anger is not bad as long as you can control it and use it as fuel to drive you to become better.</li>

					<li><b>Write down 3 people that believe in you, need you, and/or look up to you.</b> Everytime you feel like quitting I want you to look at that paper you wrote their names on or think of them, and remember how they believe in you. Think about them and remind yourself you cannot let them down.</li>

					<li><b>Rest.</b> You need a day off, your body needs it, your mind needs it. Find a day where you do absolutely nothing, you sleep in, eat what you want to eat, watch tv all day, just relax. Slack off and do nothing. You will be refueled the next day and you'll probably think about how lazy you were that day and that should anger you. Use that anger to pursue your goals once again and try to make up for that day.</li>

					<li><b>Write down your 3 strengths, 3 things that make you different from other people.</b> I really like this one because it lets you just look at yourself and learn about yourself more. Everyday from the moment you wake up remind yourself of your strengths, what you're good at, and what you've accomplished. Everyone has at least 3 strengths and has accomplished something they're proud of. Remind yourself of these things or else you'll just end up thinking you're worthless in life, which you aren't! Use this and remember you are unique!</li>
